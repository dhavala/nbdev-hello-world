    "text": "Effective ML: from Concepts to Actions\n\nEffective ML brings togeher\n\nscientific methods\nengineering tools\nand design thinking\n\nto solve practical problems.\n\nEffective ML is a set of practices and reocmmendations to build Performant, Observable, Reliable, Agile, Scalable, Faster, Cost-efficient Machine Learning\n\nThe question is – is it something new? Absolutely not. For an organization like Wadhwani AI, which focusses on applying ML/AI to solve problems, one has to counter the popular narrative, which overemphasies models over modeling. Here, modeling is all an all encompassing action verb.\nTherefore, in this edition of Effective ML, we break down the workflow into actions, and talk about which scinetific methods are useful, what engineering tools are available, and how to orchstrate these actions to build well designed, well engineered ML systems. Since models and the allied baggage is abundenty available within reach, we deliberately do not cover these aspect (i.e no algorithms and model dicussion).\nSpecifally, all topics dicussed will cover one of the following Actions:\n\nPrepare:\n\nCan we get ready to solve a problem even with zero problem-specific data? Enter the world of pre-trained models, public datasets and self-supervised learning.\nCan we be ready with the most obvious but dreaded question your clients would be asking - How much data do you need?\n\nDesign\n\nML is a piece of technology, maybe a glorified one. It is one lego piece in the puzzle! What is the puzzle we need to solve\nWhat are those lego pieces? How to solve a problem with ML and design such systems?\n\nWrite\n\nHow to write clean, readable, maintainable, modular, extensible code?\n\nDevelop\n\nHow can you collaborate with other team members? How do you manage Compute resources? Do you need to version data, code, runtimes yourself? How do you ensure your ML project is reproducible?\n\nDocument\n\nHow do you communicate the logic, pipelines, results, and metrics? Do you see writing code and documenting as separate activities? As results get updated, how do you keep your documentation up-to-date?\n\nDeploy\n\nA most important aspect of applied research is to deploy a solution. What are the many possible ways to deploy models? What are CI/CD tools to ensure only tested models get deployed?\n\nObserve\n\nWhat you can not observe, you can not understand. What you can not understand, you can not control! Observibility of an ML system pre- or post- deployment is a prerequisite to developing a healthy, verifiable ML system. How can you make your ML system - observable?\n\nTest\n\nThe IT industry, over a period of decades, developed a variety of tools, processes and practices to test software, to the extent that, new paradigms such as Test Driven Design, QA, Agile Methods, emerged. ML is nascent compared to IT & Software development – top that with inherent lack of determinism in ML systems. How to test systems, at various stages of development and deployment, in the presence of certain uncertainty.\n\nDiagnose\n\nTest & Train errors and some plots of accuracy vs time. Is that all we got? How to debug models, at various levels of granularity and from various angles?\n\nImprove/ iterate\n\nML systems, like Software products, are unfinished by design. Model development is an interactive exercise. What does it take to have a Continuous Improvement pipeline in-place?\n\n\nThe collection of works in this executable playbook is a result of 20+ people spending 20 hours together, spread across two days, listening, presenting and discussing 25+ topics. There were 15 presentations made by the ML team alone on a range of topics."
