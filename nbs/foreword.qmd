What  frame of mind is required to solve ML problems in applied settings?

* Adopt a problem-first mindset to a method-first mindset. 
* Innovating on Algorithmic research does not pay off well as much as one expects, compared to investing on the problem, data, and overall solution to solve practical problems.

> _Focus on Applied Research, not Algorithmic Research_

I hope that this collection edition of Effective ML practices helps adopt this mind to deliver value.
